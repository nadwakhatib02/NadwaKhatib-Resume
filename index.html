        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nadwa Khatib, I was born in Redlands, California on April 19, 2002. My fammily conists of my father and mother as well as my four brothers. I am the second oldest and the only daughter. I am a proud Palestinian and a first generation United States citizen as well as the second person in my family to recieve a college education. I have lived in California a majority of my life, with the exception of living in Fayetteville, North Carolina for two years. My family moves often so we have resided in numerous cities, we have lived in San Bernardino, Fayetteville, Moreno Valley, Riverside, Redlands, and Highland. Moving was rather interesting as I met many new people and gained new experiences. <br><br>

         I hope to pursue a career in Law with my Political Science degree. I have been attending the University of California, Riverside since the fall of 2020, originally being a Bioengineer but switching to Political Science in the middle of my freshman year. Prior to attending UCR, I went to Redlands High School for high school and took dual enrollment courses with Crafton Hills Community College. While in high school, I took multiple Honors and AP courses as well as ran Track and Field and was involved in multiple school runned clubs. I graduated in the year of 2020.
<br><br>

        My work experience is quite limited as of now. I volunteered at my local community center for the majority of my highschool experience. During my volunteering, I would help plan and run city wide events, create fun activities directed towards the youth so they have some place to go, and also provide food in order to ensure kids are not left hungry. I would also volunteer for school run organizations, such as helping with the Possibilities games in which we hosted Special needs students from all the schools in my district at our field and did multiple sports themed events. Outside of school, I worked at Panda Express for roughly a year. During this job, I would provide food to the community through teamwork and perseverance. I learned a lot about how to work with a group to ensure the highest quality. I also learned how to deal with money as well as improved my customer service and relations.
        In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. Some can say I am a social butterfly and a conversationalist as I can easily start and pursue conversations with people I have not met before without making it awkward. I am also considered a leader who helps keep people on track while maintaining good relations with everyone I am working with. Other than hanging out with friends and family, I like to read, particularly action themed books. My hobbies are a wide list that is constantly evolving as I encounter more things on a daily basis.
